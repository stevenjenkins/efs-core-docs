=head1 Boostrapping the Client Environment

This document will discuss how to bootstrap the EFS client
environment, once the server environment has been successfully
bootstrapped.

=head1 Initial Requirements

If it's not yet obvious, you have to complete the procedures
documented in "Bootstrapping the Server Environment".  This process is
similar, but far simpler.

=head2 EFS Compile Hosts

The EFS administrators, and any team who will be building content for
/efs/dist for that matter, needs to have access to at least one client
for each platform you wish to support in your environment.  Although
additional client platforms can certainly be added at a later date, it
is orders of magnitude more complex to accomplish once the environment
has been completely bootstrapped, and especially after you have
deployed prod cells and clients.

Note that these machines will be used to compile platform-specific
content for /efs, and they will in general NOT be used as EFS servers.
Having said that, it is prefectly reasonable to use the initial EFS
server to satisfy the requirement for one of the platforms, but once
the EFS domain goes "live", the EFS server should be used exclusively
for efsd.
