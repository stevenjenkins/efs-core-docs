=head1 Bootstrapping the Server Environment

This document will discuss how to bootstrap a new EFS domain, from the
ground up.

=head1 Initial Requirements

In order to get the first EFS dev cell up and running, you will need
the following resources:

=head2 RDBMS: Oracle or MySQL

This database will be THE database for the entire EFS infrastructure,
for both dev and prod cells, so it should be on the most reliable,
stable and well supported configuration possible.

You will need to know the full DBI connection string for this
database, for example, something like:

    DBI:Oracle:host=name.of.server.com;port=12345;sid=EFSP1
    DBI:mysql:database=efs;host=name.of.server.com;port=12345

You will also need the username/password for at least 2 different
users: the administrative login, which should have access to create
and alter objects in the database (dbouser) and the readwrite login
(rwuser), to which full write access (insert, update, delete) will be
granted to all the database objects.

In our examples, we will assume the dbouser is 'efs_dbo', and the
rwuser is 'efs_rw'.

=head2 EFS Server

A Linux server running at least Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1 or newer.
Other Linux platforms will likely work, but have not yet been tested.
This host will be configured as the primary SSL server, as well as the
initial EFS server.

=head2 NFS Server

A separate NFS server or NAS filer is required for each EFS cell.  To
build the initial dev cell for the bootstrap process, the hostname
(FQDN) of the initial NFS server is required.

=head3 Two NFS Volumes: /vol/efs_dist and /vol/efs_dev_x_yyy

These volumes must be exported to the initial EFS server with full
root access.  The compile hosts do NOT need root access to these
volumes, just the EFS server.  The name of the efs_dev volume is based
on the name of the dev cell.  If the full cell name is:

    x.yyy.foo.bar.example.com

then the volume name would be that shown above.

Each volume must have a single top level directory, named "efs_qtree".
On a NetApp NAS filer, this would be an actual qtree object.  On a
vanilla NFS server, it can be a plain directory.

=head1 Configuring the Bootstrap Process

It is possible to write a single configuration file for all of these
bootstrap utilities, export the pathname in an environment variable,
and then just invoke each script in order, with no special command
line arguments.  This is the recommended method for automating this
process.

All of the bootstrap scripts accept command line arguments to either
specify the pathname to the config file, or to specify the necessary
options explicitly.

Since most of the defaults are reasonable, only the required options
need to be specified in the config file.  A sample minimal config file
would like something like this:

    #
    # This is a sample efs bootstrap configuration file, used by the
    # various efs_bootstrap_* utilities
    #
    [global]
        root_domain = domain.org

    [database]
        connect     = DBI:mysql:database=efs;host=dbserver.domain.org;port=12345
        dbouser     = efs_dbo
        rwuser      = efs_write

    [cell]
        name        = a.bbb.ccc.ddd.domain.org
        fileserver  = some.fileserver.domain.org
        devshare    = /vol/efs_dev_a_bbb
        distshare   = /vol/efs_dist

To use the recommended approach, write the necessary information into
a file and export the following environment variable:

    export EFS_BOOTSTRAP_CONFIG=/path/to/bootstrap.conf

=head1 Installing the EFS Software

In theory, this is as simple as installing any other perl module. Just
unpack the distribution, and then do the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

In reality, however, EFS has a very long list of dependencies on CPAN
modules, some of which have dependencies on system packages which are
often optionally installed on many hosts, so installing EFS can be a
lot more work than the four simple commands above.

To simplify an otherwise complex and onerous process, we have provided
a script that automates the steps above, and the installation of most
of the dependencies.

=head2 efs_bootstrap_install

In the util subdirectory of the source distribution, we provide a
script to automate bootstrapping the installation of perl, EFS, and
all of it's CPAN dependencies.  This script is not installed
permanently, and must be run out of the source tree directly.  For
additional defails on invoking the script, see it's man page.

Of course, since the man page isn't installed until EFS has been
successfully installed, you'll need to do the following to read it:

    cd /path/to/source/distro
    pod2text < doc/efs_bootstrap_install.pod | less

By default, everything is installed with a prefix of /usr/efs, so that
EFS and it's critical dependencies are all managed in a separate
directory structure.  Eventually, you can run EFS out of /efs/dist
directly, and use it's own change control mechanisms to update the
core EFS software itself, but initially, we recommend bootstrapping
everything into /usr/efs.

=head1 Configuring the EFS Database

EFS requires either an Oracle or MySQL database.  Setting up the
database server, managing replication, backups, and other DBA related
functions are not managed by the EFS software at all.  The prerequisie
for configuring the first EFS servers, and the first EFS dev cell is a
stable database, with the correct version of the EFS schema.

=head2 Database Requirements

We require either a MySQL or Oracle database, with three database
logins for the EFS application.

=head3 MySQL Requirements

EFS has been tested against MySQL 5.1.40, using the InnoDB engine.  Be
sure to use a database engine that supports foreign keys and
transactions, and be sure to enable remote logins on the database.  A
database named "efs" is required.

=head3 Oracle Requirements

EFS has been tested against an Oracle 10g database, using the Oracle
Instant Client version 11.1.0.6.  Other combinations should work, but
as usual, YMMV.  

=head2 Login Requirements

There are three users required for EFS: the administrative user, the
readwrite user, and the readonly user.

=head3 The administrative user (dbouser)

This login is used for no purpose other than defining and updating the
DDL SQL for the database.  It is not used by the EFS software during
normal operations.  This user would normally be the database
administrator, but it can be a normal user, provided it has the
ability to create tables in the target database.

If you can not obtain such administrative access to your database (and
this is very common in many large scale environments), then you will
have to generate the SSL SQL files and provide them to your database
administrators, who can then define the objects for you.

=head3 The readwrite user (rwuser)

This is the primary login which will be used by the EFS server
processes.  This user requires select, update, insert and delete
rights on all tables (and for Oracle, sequences) in the EFS database.

=head3 The readonly user (rouser)

This login should be configured with nothing more than select access
to all objects in the EFS database.  This user is intended for the
purpose of developing auditing and reporting utilities against the EFS
database, which do not need write access to any of the objects.

=head2 Granting Database Access

=head2 MySQL

Once the above user's have been created, then they need to be given
access to the contents of the "efs" database.  The following grants
need to be made, using the appropriate usernames:

    GRANT ALL ON efs.* TO 'dbouser'\@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON efs.* TO 'rwuser'\@'%';
    GRANT SELECT ON efs.* TO 'rouser'\@'%';

=head2 Oracle

The DDL SQL for Oracle includes specific grants for each and every
object (tables and sequences) created, so the permissioning is handled
automatically.

=head2 Bootstrapping the DDL SQL

We provide a script to bootstrap the DDL SQL in the database, and
write the initial version of /etc/efs/server.conf.  Before you can
invoke the script, you will need the following information:

=over

=item DBI connection string

The DBI connection string for accessing the database typically looks
something like this:

   DBI:mysql:database=efs;host=some.host.your.domain;port=12345
   DBI:Oracle:host=some.host.your.domain;port=12345;sid=FOO

For systems using other naming services, or products such as Oracle's
clustering software, the syntax might be radically different.  The
specific syntax depends on how your database infrastructure is
managed.

=item Username/password for rwuser, dbouser and rouser

If the dbouser username is not provided, then the script will generate
the DDL SQL files, instead of actually uploading them.

=back

The script itself is invoked from the root of the source distribution.

    ./util/efs_bootstrap_database 

If you prefer not to specify passwords on the command line, or in the
config file, then omit those options, and you will be queried for each
password, individually.

For information on how to invoke efs_bootstrap_database, and it's CLI
options, see it's man page.

Note that this script also does not need to be run as root.  It can be
run as a non-root user, provided it has write access to
/var/efs/etc/passwd and /etc/efs.

=head1 Configuring the EFS Domain and the Initial Dev Cell

At this point, we have the software installed on our initial EFS
server, and we have the EFS DDL SQL defined in the database.  Now, we
can bootstrap our new EFS domain, and get EFS fully functioning on the
EFS server itself.  This script is also run from the root of the
source distribution:

    ./util/efs_bootstrap_domain

For information on how to invoke efs_bootstrap_domain, and it's
configuration options, see it's man page.

This script, unlike the others, B<MUST> be run as root.  The others
will typically be run as root, but strictly speaking, simply need
write access to a number of specific files and directories.

=head1 Initializing the EFS Namespace

The last script to bootstrap the environment also serves to test the
success of the previous scripts.  This last utility is B<NOT> run as
root, it is run as one of the members of the "efsops" administrative
group.  This script, like the others, is run from the root directory
of the source distribution:

    ./util/efs_bootstrap_namespace

For information on how to invoke efs_bootstrap_domain, and it's
configuration options, see it's man page.

Once this has completed, then the initial dev cell is online and
operational, but the EFS CLI can only be used on the initial EFS
server.

=head1 The Results

At this point, you now have a fully bootstrapped EFS domain, with it's
initial dev cell, an EFS server running efsd, and a fully configured
database.  However, this isn't terribly exciting, because you can only
use EFS on this one machine.

The next stage of the bootstrapping process involves building the EFS
distribution on each of the UNIX platforms you have chosen to support,
and building the client packages that will be used to install the EFS
client throughout your environment.
